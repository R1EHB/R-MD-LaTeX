This 1/2-day workshop will provide attendees with hands-on experience
using the basics of LaTeX, Markdown, and the R package knitr. After
attending this workshop, you will be able to use these tools to
facilitate reproducible reports and research with R.

The draft agenda:

\begin{tabular}{c|l}
    \textbf{Time} & \textbf{Topic} \\
    8:30-8:45 & Discussion of reproducible research \\
    8:45-9:00 & LaTeX in a standalone environment \\

\section{You will need}
It is expected that you have some familiarity with R and RStudio, can
install packages from CRAN, and understand basic R syntax.

We will be using R, RStudio, and MiKTeX during this workshop. These must be installed prior to September 11.
\begin{itemize}
    \item R, RStudio
    \item MiKTeX
    \item Your preferred TeX editor (TeXStudio, TeXWorks, ShareLaTeX, emacs, notepad, notepad++, etc.)
    \item R packages:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item knitr
        \item ggplot2 (or all of tidyverse)
        \item pandoc
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{R and RStudio}
Simply email EZTech, now ``EISD", at
\href{mailto:EISD@epa.gov}{EISD@epa.gov}) and request that R and
RStudio be installed on your machine. They will usually push that out
within a day or so.

\subsection{MiKTeX}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Go to \url{https://usepa.sharepoint.com/sites/EZForms/SitePages/Home.aspx}
    \item Under Create a Request, click on ''Freeware/Shareware''
    \item Fill out your employee info
    \item For ``Justification'', say: Needed in conjunction with R and
      associated packages to create self-contained documentation and
      reports using R. This makes the paradigm of reproducible
      research feasible with data analysis. MiKTeX is a bundling of
      the TeX and LaTeX typesetting tools for Windows OS. The website
      for MiKTeX base download and installation is:
      https://miktex.org/download
    \item For ``Software Title'', say: MiKTeX
    \item Enter supervisor name
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{TeX Editor}

% Any good text editor will do.
% Word is not a great text editor.
% Notepad is workable.
