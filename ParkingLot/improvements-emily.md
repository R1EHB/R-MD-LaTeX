# Improvements for the future

Emily's notes on the 9/11 workshop to improve it for the rescheduled R User Group Workshop.

## Slides and presentation
+ Participants expressed that the slides were very helpful
- The pace should be a little faster, with no skipping around. Skipping around confused some people (my bad!). I need to print the slides out for myself so I can keep better track of where we are.

Some problems might be mitigated with both presenters in the same room.
- Presenting from one screen for everyone
- One person able to dedicate some more attention to remote attendees

Feedback relating to presenters:

"I felt that the workshop was a bit disorganized - there were times
when Emily and Erik were shuffling to get things set up or figuring
out where to go next."

## Challenges with hands-on examples

One person gave really good feedback on how difficult it can be to get
participants to work with hands-on examples when everyone has
different technical issues.

"The description of the workshop says, “Participants will then get to
use these modules synchronously to facilitate reproducible reports and
research with R.”  There was not time for us to do a practice problem.
With all the different operating systems, package installations, and
difficulty troubleshooting remote participants errors, I think it
makes sense not to do practice problems.  But, to my point above, I
would have liked to see more examples of each code and more
comparisons."

Another participant expressed a similar request for more examples.

"I think one thing that would be really helpful when starting this
session would be to share examples of completed projects, one using
markdown and one using LaTeX to better illustrate (1) what the final
product looks like, (2) the advantages of each over no code
documentation (i.e. what do they allow you to document, what do they
make easier, etc.), and (3) when to use one instead of the other."

## Pre-workshop emailed instructions
- Instructions for MikTeX installations
  1. Should clarify that MikTeX is NOT an R package and is a standalone installation.
  1. Should include instructions to install MacTeX for Mac OS users and TeX Live for Linus users.
- Consolidate installation instructions with compiler instructions. 
- Maybe state that we will not be able to spend much time troubleshooting attendees' technical problems at the workshop, so attendees are responsible for troubleshooting before coming to the session (we can maybe help a little if Google doesn't, if you give us enough time).

## Technical problems
- Loaner laptops --- R & RStudio were installed but not MikTeX and the `knitr` R package
- Wifi
  1. People that said they were bringing personal laptops had not been given instructions on how to get on the wifi
  1. Need to bring USB sticks with data and slides on them
- Time: "Never start before 8:30am eastern time for us west coasters : ) "

## Feedback on the workshop in general

- Several of those registered from RTP expressed to me that there were too many emails going out relating to the workshop, even before the hurricane decisions.
- It was especially confusing that the whole event was called a workshop but individual workshops were also each called a workshop.
