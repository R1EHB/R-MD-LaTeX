# Goals #
## Improve EPA Region One Emergency Communications Ability ##
## Interoperability with other agencies (Federal, state, local) via voice (HF, VHF, UHF, satellite) and data (HF, VHF, UHF, satellite) ##


# Objectives #

* Bring VHF and UHF capability to the mobile command post (MCP).
* Bring HF capability (including HF SHARES) to the mobile command post.
* Improve HF capability (including HF SHARES) at the Coop site (NERL or lab in Chelmsford).
* Acquire ability to establish radio communcations between 5 PO Square and NERL.
* Acquire ability to establish radio communcations between NERL and MCP.
* Acquire ability to establish radio communcations between 5 PO Square and MCP.
* Ensure the ability to have communications at an incident between the Incident Command Post (ICP), MCP, and the field locations.
* Ensure that key EPA staff have the credentials and capability to drive MCP (get CDL)

# Capabilities Needed #
* Data capabilities at the lab and elsewhere using HF (Pactor & Winlink)
* Improve automatic link establishment ability (ALE) at the lab.


# Work to Do #
## Mobile Command Post ##
### VHF and UHF ###
* Check all radios currently in the MCP
* Check all radio cables currently in the MCP
* Check programming ability and programming installed for all radios currently in the MCP
* Check antenna mounts on the MCP
* Fix any bad antenna mounts
* Acquire antennas

### HF ###
* Need to establish HF capabilities in the MCP
* NVIS antenna setup (local)
* DX antenna setup (distance)
* Mobile stationary
* Mobile underway


## Lab ##
### VHF and UHF ###
* Assess equipment needs

### HF ###
* Finish OEME Library Remote Head project (Erik Beck)
* Check existing NVIS antenna and repair as needed


# Prospective Purchases #
## MCP ##
* VHF and UHF Antennas
* HF transciever(s), antennas, etc


## Chelmsford Lab (NERL, OEME) ##
* Repairs for current HF antenna
* More frequency agile and sensitive transciever
* VHF/UHF equipment
* Pactor modem
* Winlink computer



# Other Issues & Parking Lot #
* Fly-away kits
* Deployability for ARRL Field Day, June 2019 (testing and training)
* Deployabiity for Federal Interoperability Day (testing and training)
