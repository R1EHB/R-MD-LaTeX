\section{List of pre-requisites}
It is expected that you have some familiarity with R and RStudio, can install packages from CRAN, and understand basic R syntax.

We will be using R, RStudio, and MiKTeX during this workshop. These must be installed prior to September 11.
\begin{itemize}
    \item R, RStudio
    \item MiKTeX
    \item R packages:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item knitr
        \item ggplot2 (or all of tidyverse)
        \item pandoc
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{R and RStudio}

Simply email EZTech, now ``EISD", at \href{mailto:EISD@epa.gov}{EISD@epa.gov}) and request that R and RStudio be installed on your machine. They will usually push that out within a day or so.

\section{MiKTeX}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Go to \url{https://usepa.sharepoint.com/sites/EZForms/SitePages/Home.aspx}
    \item Under Create a Request, click on ``Freeware/Shareware"
    \item Fill out your employee info
    \item For ``Justification", say: Needed in conjunction with R and associated packages to create self-contained documentation and reports using R. This makes the paradigm of reproducible research feasible with data analysis. MiKTeX is a bundling of the TeX and LaTeX typesetting tools for Windows OS. The website for MiKTeX base download and installation is: https://miktex.org/download
    \item For “Software Title”, say: MiKTeX
    \item Enter supervisor name
\end{enumerate}
