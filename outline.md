# Mini-Abstract #

**Using LaTeX and Markdown for Reproducible Research**

Taking a modular approach and a stepwise fashion, Erik and Emily will
teach participants the basics of LaTeX, Markdown, and the R package
knitr. These modules will then lead to using these tools to facilitate
reproducible reports and research with R. Participants will then get
to use these modules synchronously to facilitate reproducible reports
and research with R.


# Objectives #

* Discussion of LaTeX in a standalone Environment
* Discussion of Markdown in a standalone Environment
* How Markdown and LaTeX can work together (still in isolation)

* R and reproducible research tools (knitr, sweave, etc, but strong
  emphasis on knitr)

* How Markdown and LaTeX can work with R (especially knitr) for
  reproducible research
