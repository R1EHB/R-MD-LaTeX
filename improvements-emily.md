# Improvements for the future

Emily's notes on the 9/11 workshop to improve it for the rescheduled R User Group Workshop.

## Slides and presentation
* Slide order in the PDF was good, but skipping around confused some people (my bad). I need to print the slides out for myself so I can keep better track of where we are in the agenda.
* Faster pacing and less skipping around

## Problems that might be mitigated with both presenters in the same room
* Presenting from one screen for everyone
* One person able to dedicate some more attention to remote attendees

## Pre-workshop emailed instructions
* Instructions for MikTeX installations
  1. Should clarify that MikTeX is NOT an R package and is a standalone installation.
  1. Should include instructions to install MacTeX for Mac OS users and TeX Live for Linus users.
* Consolidate installation instructions with compiler instructions

## Technical problems
* Loaner laptops --- R/RStudio were installed but not MikTeX and the `knitr` R package
* Wifi
  1. People that said they were bringing personal laptops had not been given instructions on how to get on the wifi
  1. Need to bring USB sticks with data and slides on them
