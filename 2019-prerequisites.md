# Using R, Markdown, and Other Tools for Reproducible Research #
When: **Tuesday**, August 13th, 2019 at **8:30 AM - 12:00 PM**

Where: **Room C111C** for on-site attendees. **Skype or phone (see below)** for remote attendees.

Speakers: Erik Beck, US EPA, Region 1; Emily Li, US EPA, ORD/NRMRL.

Description: Participants will learn the basics of Markdown, LaTeX and
the R package `knitr`. They will then proceed to use these tools to
facilitate reproducible research (and reports) with R. Participants
will be given resources to try later as a reinforcement to the topics
discussed.
