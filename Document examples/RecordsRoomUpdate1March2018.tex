Intra Surface Water Branch Memorandum

Date: March 1, 2018
To:   Surface Water Branch, All Employees
Re:   Records Room Roundup
From: Erik Beck

Here is the current information regarding the Records Room Project:

1) Customized records schedules for the branch (and the division) will
 be posted soon on the R1 Intranet;

2) Next phase of project, re-cataloging files in the records room,
 will start for OEP (has already started in other divisions);

3) Will be using new database system for the new catalog

4) Will be using a check-in and check-out system for files in the file
 rooms (Rick Carvalho's method);

5) After inventory is completed, cleanup of records rooms (destroy or
 ship records to FRC);

6) Target Date for completion of comprehensive cataloging: December
 31, 2017 (or ASAP);

7) Target date for cleanup completion: March 31, 2018 (or ASAP);

Reminder, what is this all about again (what's the point?)

1) Consolidate and decommission records rooms;

2) Save space and money (less square feet occupied by EPA equals less
 B&F Funds spent, equals potential transfer to EP&M (travel, FTE,
 etc));

3) Destroy obsolete records, move eligible inactive and closed files
 to FRC and National Archives

4) Make room for newer files and NARA requirements;

New NARA Requirements

1) Go digital, G-Men and G-Women;

2) By December 2022, FRC/National Archives will stop accepting
 documents in non-digital format.

Note:
1) Records at FRC can be recalled;
2) Records at National Archives can't be recalled, but do accept walk-in visits;
