\title{Historical Documentation on Maintenance of Effort (MOE) for
  NHDES CWA 319: Letter to File}

\maketitle

\section{Narrative}
Pursuant to EPA Region One's new (as of early calendar 2018) ``Funding
Request Return To Sender Policy (Better known as the ``Elvis''
Policy),'' increased documentation of Maintenance of Effort
requirements is needed. This ``Letter to the File'' documents the MOE
amount for New Hampshire's CWA 319 program.  Per CWA 319(h), the
metric for MOE is permanently set based on state spending on the
program during the mid-1980's. Given that the requirement is based on
information from the distant past, finding primary or secondary source
material documenting this requirement is difficult.  However,  during
a review of old grant documents, sufficent documentation was found in
NHDES 319 FFY 1990 grant (C9-001219-90-0). That information is
reproduced below.

The relevant MOE amount for NHDES' 319 Nonpoint Source Prgram is
\$22,521 (annual).
