# Grant Specific Programmatic Terms and Conditions #
## Nonpoint Source Program, CWA Section 319 ##

## Specific Section 319 Requirements ##

**1) Reporting Requirements:**

* The recipient agrees to comply with all reporting requirements
required by EPA regulation (40 CFR part 35, 2 CFR part 200),
Sections 319(h)(10) and (11) of the Clean Water Act (CWA), and by the Nonpoint
Source Program and Grants Guidelines for States and Territories
(2013). Failure to comply with the above referenced reporting
requirements may result in a disruption of grantee funding and/or
early termination of the grant agreement in accordance with 2 CFR part 200.

**a) Final NPS Project Reports:**

* The recipient agrees to submit all final nonpoint source project
reports to the EPA Nonpoint Point Source Coordinator. The report must
describe project activities and identify and discuss the extent to
which project goals have been achieved, and the amount of funds spent
on the project. The report should emphasize successes, failures,
lessons learned, load reduction data, and should include any available
water quality and habitat data demonstrating project results. For
projects funded as subawards, acceptance and approval of final
subrecipient project reports is the responsibility of the recipient.

**b) Annual Nonpoint Source (NPS) Program Report:**

* The recipient agrees to provide information and report annually on
progress made in implementing the State's NPS management program as
required under Subsection 319(h)(11) of the Clean Water Act. At a
minimum, the report shall contain a summary of progress, including
rationale/evidence, in meeting the schedule of milestones in the
approved management program and reductions in NPS pollutant loading
and improvements in water quality that has resulted from
implementation of the NPS management program. Failure to submit the
annual NPS program report may affect the recipient's eligibility for
future Section 319 grant funding.

**c) GRTS:**

* The recipient shall enter all mandated data elements into the GRTS for
NPS projects funded under Section 319 of the Clean Water Act, and any other
data and/or information required by the EPA according to deadlines
specified by EPA. Initial data entry is due 90 days from award and
includes all mandated data elements except the geographic area (if
still to be determined), best management practices (BMPs) and load
reduction data. The recipient will report BMP and load reduction data
as projects are implemented. At a minimum, the BMP and load reduction
data will be reported by February 15th of each year for projects
implementing BMPs in the previous federal fiscal year.

**d) STORET Data Reporting:**

* The recipient agrees to enter water quality monitoring data, for data
collected in a waterbody pursuant to the implementation of a Section 319
project, into EPA's "storage and retrieval" (STORET) data system. All
water quality data generated with Section 319 funding, either directly or by
sub-award, are required to be transmitted into the STORET data
warehouse using either the Water Quality Exchange (WQX) or
WQXweb. When uploading data through WQX or WQXweb, data should be
identified as 319 grant-related by providing project ID CWA319 in the
data submission.

* If you have an existing project ID, please include this in addition to
data collected using CWA Section 319 funds. Please contact the STORET helpdesk
(Storet@epa.gov) if you need assistance assigning multiple project
IDs to a dataset.

## Other Section 319 Grant Conditions ##

4) **Working with USDA and other agencies:**
* Cooperate with USDA through
participation on the State Technical Committee, to look for
opportunities to leverage Farm Bill (e.g., EQIP, CRP, WRP) funds for
319-funded projects or other high priority watershed restoration
needs. Continue to work with other government agencies to address and
improve areas of environmental concern (e.g., impaired waters,
compliance with instream flow and water level rules, fragile waters in
need of protection, and a watershed approach).

5) **Satisfactory and Sufficient Progress:**
* EPA may terminate the assistance agreement for
failure of the recipient to make sufficient progress so as to
reasonably ensure completion of the project within the project period,
including any extensions. EPA will measure sufficient progress by
examining the performance required under the workplan in conjunction
with the milestone schedule, the time remaining for performance within
the project period, and/or the availability of funds necessary to
complete the project. In determining sufficient progress, EPA may also
consider the rate of expenditure of funds (unliquidated obligations),
as well as the findings from the most recent section 319 performance
and progress determination. (See EPA's Guidance and Checklist for
Determining Progress of State Nonpoint Source Management Programs). A
key metric for determining sufficient progress will be the annual
Satisfactory Progress Determinations, AKA Performance Progress
Determinations, as described in CWA 319 (h)(8). EPA expects the
grantee to participate in ongoing discussions and provide sufficient
documentation for the Region to make a determination of satisfactory
progress.

6) **National Guidelines:**
* Use the most current Nonpoint Source Program
and Grants Guidelines for states and territories to identify eligible
activities, program priorities, and reporting requirements.

7) **On-the-ground Implementation:**
* Continue to implement structural and
non-structural BMPs that result in restoration of impaired waters and
protection of healthy and threatened waters. The state's approach will
align with national NPS guidelines.

8) **Participation in Regional and National Meetings:**

* Exchanging information at Regional and National meetings is a critical
part of an effective Nonpoint Source Management Program. Therefore,
the recipient agrees to attend annual Nonpoint Source Manager's
meetings and GRTS users meeting, as scheduled, unless agreed upon in
advance by the EPA NPS Coordinator for the applicable state.

9) **TMDLs Developed Under Section 319 Grant:**

* Each 319-funded TMDL will include the following elements: (1) total
NPS existing loads and total NPS load reductions required to meet
water quality standards, by source type; (2) a detailed identification
of the causes and sources of NPS pollution by source type that will
need to be controlled to achieve the load reductions required by the
TMDL (e.g., acres of various row crops, number and size of animal
feedlots, acres and density of residential areas); and (3) an analysis
of the NPS management measures by source type to achieve the necessary
load reductions, with the recognition that adaptive management may be
necessary during implementation.

10) **Watershed-based Plans:**

* Under the CWA 319 guidelines, use of 319 "watershed project" funds
requires that a watershed-based plan (WBP) which includes all of the
information in elements (a)-(i) as described in the 319 grant
guidelines or an acceptable alternative plan be completed prior to
implementation of on- the-ground projects. The recipient shall ensure
a watershed-based plan or acceptable alternative plan is completed
prior to beginning to implement any on-the-ground project with 319
watershed project funds.

* One nine-element WBP per state will be submitted annually to the
Region for rewview; all alternative watershed-based plans will be
submitted to the Region for review and approval.

11) **Operation and Maintenance:**

* The recipient will assure the continued proper operation and
maintenance of all nonpoint source management practices that have been
implemented for projects funded under this agreement.  Such practices
shall be operated and maintained for the expected lifespan of the
specific practice and in accordance with commonly accepted
standards. The recipient shall include a provision in every applicable
sub-agreement (subgrant or contract) awarded requiring that the
management practices for the project be properly operated and
maintained.  Likewise, the sub-agreement will assure that similar
provisions are included in any sub-agreements that are awarded by the
sub-recipient.


12) **Maintenance of Effort:**

* State expenditures for NPS implementation activities must meet the
maintenance of effort (MOE) level required under 319(h)(9) of the
Clean Water Act. No grant may be made to a State under this
subsection in any fiscal year unless such State enters into such
agreements with the Administrator as the Administrator may require to
ensure that such State will maintain its aggregate expenditures from
all other sources for programs for controlling pollution added to the
navigable waters in such State from nonpoint sources and improving the
quality of such waters at or above the average level of such
expenditures in its two fiscal years preceding February 4, 1987. The
state should assure that MOE requirements have been satisfied and
report this through the final Federal Financial Report (FFR) at the
end of the budget period.

13) **Priority-Setting:**

* Target 319 funding toward restoration of
priority segments, water bodies or watersheds (e.g., Measure SP-12
watershed commitments) and protection of high priority healthy and
threatened waters. Inform EPA of the state's priority-setting
methodology (e.g., EPA's Recovery Potential Screening Tool or some
other process).

14) **Required Non-Federal Share Requirements:**

* A minimum of 40% non-federal program contribution (of the total
project cost) is required under 319(h)(3). The state should assure
that the state share requirements have been satisfied and report this
through the final Federal Financial Report (FFR) at the end of the
budget period.

15) **Limitation on Administrative Costs:**

* In accordance with 319(h)(12) of the Clean Water Act, administrative
costs in the form of salaries, overhead, or indirect costs shall not
exceed in any fiscal year 10 percent of the amount of the grant except
that costs of implementing enforcement and regulatory activities,
education, training, technical assistance, demonstration projects, and
technology transfer programs shall not be subject to this limitation.

16) **Obligation and Outlay of Funds:**

* In accordance with 319(h)(6) of the Clean Water Act, the recipient
will show commitment to expend the funds awarded in this grant and to
complete the funded projects in accordance with its EPA approved
Nonpoint Source management program and the approved work plan. The
recipient will award all proposed contracts, subawards and interagency
agreements within one year from the date of the categorical grant
award or in the case of states that accept 319 funds as a part of the
Performance Partnership Grants (PPG), within one year after the full
annual allocation has been provided.

17) **NPS Success Stories:**

* The recipient must draft and submit to EPA all applicable NPS program
success stories which highlight projects resulting in the restoration
of waterbodies. These stories shall be submitted through the success
story database in GRTS.


18) **Clean Water Act Section 319 Non-Point Source Assistance Agreements:**

* Public Awareness Terms and Conditions (Effective October 1, 2014)

a. **Outreach Signage Requirements:** If the 319 award includes an outreach
component, the recipient agrees to provide signage that informs the
public that the project is funded by EPA. The signage shall contain
the EPA logo. To obtain the appropriate EPA logo or seal graphic file,
the recipient should send a request directly to OPA and include the
EPA Project Officer in the communication. Instructions for contacting
OPA is available at:
http://www2.epa.gov/stylebook/using-epa-seal-and-logo. The EPA Logo
will be displayed meeting the following specifications:
http://www.epa.gov/ogd/tc/epa_logo_seal_specifications_for_infrastructure_grants.pdf. If
the physical design of the sign allows, it should also include the
following text: "This project has been funded by the United States
Environmental Protection Agency" or: "This cooperative project has
been funded in part by the United States Environmental Protection
Agency" Exceptions for including the EPA logo may be made by the
Regional 319 Coordinator on recommendation by the State.

b. **Announcements:**  The grant recipient agrees that announcements through
the web or print materials for Workshop, conference, demonstration
days or other events as part of a project funded by a 319 assistance
agreement shall contain a statement that the materials or conference
has been funded by the United States Environmental protection Agency.

c. **Public or Media Events:** The Recipient agrees to notify the EPA
Project Officer listed in this award document of public or media
events publicizing the accomplishment of significant events related to
construction projects as a result of this agreement, and provide the
opportunity for attendance and participation by federal
representatives with at least ten (10) working days' notice.

d. **Limited English Proficiency Communities:** To increase public
awareness of projects serving communities where English is not the
predominant language, recipients are encouraged to include in their
outreach strategies communication in non-English
languages. Translation costs for this purpose are allowable, provided
the costs are reasonable.



19) **Special NPDES Grant Condition:**

* If work funded pursuant to this grant agreement becomes required
to be implemented by a National Pollution Discharge Elimination System
(NPDES) permit, the work from that time forward will no longer be
eligible for funding under this grant agreement. This pertains to all
current final effective NPDES permits, including general and
individual permits for wastewater, combined sewer overflows, and
stormwater discharges (construction, multi-sector, MS4 permits). For
purposes of this provision, work will be considered to be "required to
be implemented" and thus not eligible for funding under this grant
agreement whenever there is a final permit, an Order, or letter or
other written directive issued by EPA, the state, or a court to do the
work.

* Note: NPDES permittees may not use CWA Section 319 funded projects to
meet a NPDES permit condition.  For example, nutrient reductions and
outreach materials that result from projects that are supported with
Section 319 funding may not be used by a permit applicant to meet a
NPDES permit condition.


## General Programmatic Requirements ##

20) **Acknowledgement Requirement:**

* The  recipeint agrees  that  any reports,  documents, publications  or
other materials  developed for  public distribution supported  by this
assistance agreement shall contain the following statement:

* "This project has been funded wholly or in part by the United States
 Environmental Protection Agency under assistance agreement (number)
 to (recipient). The contents of this document do not necessarily
 reflect the views and policies of the Environmental Protection
 Agency, nor does the EPA endorse trade names or recommend the use of
 commercial products mentioned in this document."

21) **Food and Refreshments:**
* Unless the event(s) and all of its
components (i.e., receptions, banquets and other activities that take
place after normal business hours) are described in the approved
workplan, the recipient agrees to obtain prior approval from EPA for
the use of grant funds for light refreshments and/or meals served at
meetings, conferences, training workshops, and outreach activities
(events). The recipient must send requests for approval to the EPA
Project Officer and include:

* An estimated budget and description for the light refreshments,
meals, and/or beverages to be served at the event(s);

* A description of the purpose, agenda, location, length and timing
for the event.

* An estimated number of participants in the event and a description
of their roles.

* Recipients may address questions about whether costs for light
refreshments, and meals for events are allowable to the recipient's
EPA Project Officer. However, the Agency Award Official or Grant
Management Officer will make final determinations on
allowability. Agency policy prohibits the use of EPA funds for
receptions, banquets and similar activities that take place after
normal business hours unless the recipient has provided a
justification that has been expressly approved by EPA's Award Official
or Grants Management Officer.

* NB: U.S. General Services Administration regulations define light
refreshments for morning, afternoon or evening breaks to include, but
not be limited to, coffee, tea, milk, juice, soft drinks, donuts,
bagels, fruit, pretzels, cookies, chips, or muffins (41 CFR
301-74.7).

22)  **Pre-award Costs:**

* In accordance with 2 CFR 1500.8, the grantee may charge pre-award
costs (both Federal and non-Federal matching shares) incurred from May
31, 2018 to the actual award date provided that such costs were
contained in the approved application and all costs are incurred
within the approved budget period.

23) **Competency of Organizations Generating Environmental Measurement Data:**

* In accordance with EPA's Policy to Assure the Competency of
Organizations Generating Environmental Measurement Data under
Agency-Funded Assistance Agreements, for all awards where the maximum
value of the assistance agreement will exceed $200,000 in federal
funding and the project will involve the generation or use of
environmental data, the Recipient will be required to demonstrate
competency prior to award. Alternatively, where a pre-award
demonstration of competency is not practicable, the Recipient must
demonstrate competency prior to carrying out any activities under the
award involving the generation or use of environmental data. The
Recipient shall maintain competency for the duration of the project
period of this agreement and this will be documented during the annual
reporting process. A copy of the Policy, including methods by which
competency may be demonstrated, is available online at
http://www.epa.gov/fem/lab_comp.htm.

* For all continuing program grants, project grants, and cooperative
agreements to recipients with approved QMPs, or grants (for example
one-time grants) that do not require QMPs: The recipient will develop
Quality Assurance Project Plans (QAPP), or equivalent documents
defined by the QMP, for all applicable projects and tasks involving
environmental data in accordance with the most current National
requirement documents http://www.epa.gov/quality1/ and Regional
requirement documents
https://www.epa.gov/quality/region-1-quality-systems-documents.  Other
EPA guidance documents provided at these sites may be helpful in
meeting the requirements.  The term "environmental data" refers to any
measurement or information that describe environmental processes,
conditions, or location; ecological or health effects and
consequences; or the performance of environmental technology.  For
EPA, environmental data include information collected directly from
measurements, produced from models, and compiled from other sources
such as data bases or the literature.  The QAPP must be approved by
EPA prior to any data gathering work or use, except under
circumstances requiring immediate action to protect human health and
the environment or operations conducted under police powers.  Unless
an alternate schedule was previously agreed upon, no later than 30
days prior to the scheduled commencement of data collection and/or
data generation activities, the recipient will submit a QAPP to the
following:
 
* EPA Project Officer (see page 1 of assistance agreement for name and
address) and Regional Quality Assurance Manager (EQA):

* U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 11 Technology Drive, North Chelmsford, MA 01863
 
* For organizations having an EPA-approved Quality Management Plan
(QMP), the recipient will submit an annual update letter to EPA
documenting progress over the year and any changes to the QMP.  Annual
update letters will be sent every year for four years until the
expiration of the QMP (five years from initial EPA approval).  Annual
QA update letters will be sent to the EPA Project Officer and the RQAM
on the anniversary of the approval of the QMP by the RQAM; or on
another mutually agreeable schedule.  In addition, for multi-year
projects, the grantee shall confirm that the QAPP is current and
accurate.

24) **Programmatic Subaward Reporting Requirement:**

* The recipient must report on its subaward monitoring activities under
2 CFR 200.331(d).  Examples of items that must be reported if the
pass-through entity has the information available are:

* Summaries of results of reviews of financial and programmatic reports.

* Summaries of findings from site visits and/or desk reviews to ensure
effective subrecipient performance.

* Environmental results the subrecipient achieved.

* Summaries of audit findings and related pass-through entity
  management decisions.

* Actions the pass-through entity has taken to correct deficiencies
such as those specified at 2 CFR 200.331(e), 2 CFR 200.207 and the 2
CFR Part 200.338 Remedies for Noncompliance.

25) **Copyrighted Material:**

* The recipient must comply with the
requirements regarding copyrights described in 2 CFR part 200.315,
"Intangible property."

26) **Cyber Security Condition:**

State Grant Cybersecurity Condition 

(a) The recipient agrees that when collecting and managing
environmental data under this assistance agreement, it will protect
the data by following all applicable State law cybersecurity
requirements.

(b)

(1) EPA must ensure that any connections between the recipient’s
network or information system and EPA networks used by the recipient
to transfer data under this agreement, are secure.  For purposes of
this Section, a connection is defined as a dedicated persistent
interface between an Agency IT system and an external IT system for
the purpose of transferring information.  Transitory, user-controlled
connections such as website browsing are excluded from this
definition.  If the recipient’s connections as defined above do not go
through the Environmental Information Exchange Network or EPA’s
Central Data Exchange, the recipient agrees to contact the EPA Project
Officer (PO) and work with the designated Regional/Headquarters
Information Security Officer to ensure that the connections meet EPA
security requirements, including entering into Interconnection Service
Agreements as appropriate. This condition does not apply to manual
entry of data by the recipient into systems operated and used by EPA’s
regulatory programs for the submission of reporting and/or compliance
data.

(2) The recipient agrees that any subawards it makes under this
agreement will require the subrecipient to comply with the
requirements in (b)(1) if the subrecipient’s network or information
system is connected to EPA networks to transfer data to the Agency
using systems other than the Environmental Information Exchange
Network or EPA’s Central Data Exchange. The recipient will be in
compliance with this condition: by including this requirement in
subaward agreements; and during subrecipient monitoring deemed
necessary by the recipient under 2 CFR 200.331(d), by inquiring
whether the subrecipient has contacted the EPA Project
Officer. Nothing in this condition requires the recipient to contact
the EPA Project Officer on behalf of a subrecipient or to be involved
in the negotiation of an Interconnection Service Agreement between the
subrecipient and EPA.


27) **Geospatial Data Standards:**

* All geospatial data created must be consistent with Federal Geographic
Data Committee (FGDC) endorsed standards.  Information on these
standards may be found at www.fgdc.gov.

28) **Permits:**

* The recipient agrees to ensure that necessary permits (such as Clean
Water Act 404) are obtained prior to implementation the grant funded
activities that may fall under applicable federal, state or local
laws. The subrecipient's project implementation plan must identify
permits that may be needed to complete work plan activities. The
recipient must keep documentation regarding necessary permits in the
project file. EPA approval of a workplan does not imply nor guarantee
that a federal, state, or local permit will be issued for a particular
activity.
